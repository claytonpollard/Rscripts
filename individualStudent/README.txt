This shiny app is for quickly looking at an individual students performance against the grade.

For the date.csv, ensure:
- col1 is the class
- col2 is the name
- col3 is task1 result (out of 100)
- col4 is task2 result (out of 100)

*** If it doesn't knit check to make sure the working directory is set to source file location. Else you can manually set the path to your data.csv in line 14. ***
